IMPORTANT
We use a Bot to manage the NAP list, the StarCrusader bot. If you are the first of your alliance to join this discord, please register your alliance with the bot using the !addAlliance command.
You can also install this bot to your alliance's discord server, which you can then use to view the NAP list, the NAP rules, or details about a specific alliance.
If installed, the bot will also notify your discord server when alliances are added or removed to/from the NAP list!
StarCrusader bot can be installed using this link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=823623128596742196&permissions=100352&scope=bot
If your alliance is not on this NAP list, it will not be considered a part of the NAP!
